Version 3.0.2
 * Fixed bug where an epoll FD event could not support both READ and WRITE
   events at the same time.

Version 3.0.1
Credit to Brendon Jones for the bug fixes in this release
 * Fixed bug where wand_del_signal would not completely remove the signal
   from the signal map.
 * Fixed numerous minor memory errors that cause valgrind to complain.

Version 3.0.0
 * Changed API for adding and deleting all types of event callbacks. Rather
   than populating a struct and passing it in to libwandevent, the add methods
   now simply take the struct members as parameters and perform all the 
   memory management for the user. This helps prevent a number of bugs caused
   when the same struct was badly reused by a user.
   Overall, the new approach is much more intuitive and requires less effort
   on the part of the user but it does mean that the API has changed quite
   significantly. Old libwandevent programs will need to be updated to use the
   new API.
 * Added support for epoll, which is preferred over conventional select. If
   the underlying OS doesn't support epoll, libwandevent will fallback to 
   using select.
 * Fixed bug where the monotonic time was not being set correctly if no
   monotonic clock was present.
 * Fixed bug where signal events could not be added or deleted inside a signal
   event callback.

Version 2.0.1
 * Fixed bug where it was possible to add the same timer twice, possibly
   creating a loop in the timer list.
 * Fixed leaking of signal file descriptors.
